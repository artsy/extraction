# Artsy+UIFonts

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/artsy/Artsy-UIFonts.svg?token=ME6xZEJvGHBYoj9nMyp2)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/artsy/Artsy-UIFonts)

This project contains the fonts and UIFont categories required to make a project with standard artsy design. 
To make it work you have to include in the Applications XX-Info.plist. See [here](https://github.com/artsy/Artsy-UIFonts/blob/master/Example/FontApp/FontApp-Info.plist#L37-L45) for an example.

```
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
	<string>AGaramondPro-BoldItalic.otf</string>
	<string>AGaramondPro-Bold.otf</string>
	<string>AGaramondPro-Italic.otf</string>
	<string>AGaramondPro-Regular.otf</string>
	<string>ITC_Avant_Garde_Gothic__Demi.ttf</string>
	<string>AGaramondPro-Semibold.otf</string>
</array>
```

## License

Artsy+UIFonts is not open source `:(` - this is mainly so that we don't give out other people's fonts. That's ok though.
